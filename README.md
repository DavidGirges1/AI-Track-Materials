# 🧠 AI Track Materials

Welcome to the official repository for the **AI Track** I designed and led as part of my school's Computer Science Club during the **Summer of 2023**. This track was created to share my passion for artificial intelligence, generative models, and their practical applications. It offered hands-on experiences, real-world tools, and creative projects aimed at sparking curiosity and innovation among students.
